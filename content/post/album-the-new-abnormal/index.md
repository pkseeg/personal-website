I'll be honest, I'd put this as only the 5th best Strokes album.

1. Is This It
2. First Impressions Of Earth (my personal favorite)
3. Room On Fire
(Some empty space)
4. Angles
(Some more empty space)
5. The New Abnormal
(5,000 lines of empty space)
6. Comedown Machine

Julian feels like he's finally figured out his falsetto, as well as how frequently to use it, but the rest of the ensemble seems bored. The reason I loved The Strokes growing up was the lazy, anxious anger. Now they're just lazy.

That being said, they're still my favorite band, and this album was awesome. Ode To The Mets was this hauntingly sad ballad, Bad Decisions was super catchy, Julian's random grunts were welcomed, and Fab still has the best sound alive. Here's to more good Strokes music.
