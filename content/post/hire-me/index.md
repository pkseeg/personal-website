I took my parents to lunch last month. For the first time since I started my PhD 3 years ago, they asked me what I actually do every day. My parents weren't big into school, so graduate school has been kind of a foreign concept for all of us. After describing a specific research problem that I've been working on, my dad asked me point blank: "but, like, what do you see as your skillset? What are you good at?" 

Which means he listened to me ramble about my research for like 20 minutes and then seemingly thought "why would anyone ever hire this kid?"

He asks a great question, honestly. I somehow both a) have pretty limited work experience and b) might be "over-qualified" for certain entry-level jobs based on my academic background. What are early-career PhDs like myself actually useful for? How are we supposed to bring value to a for-profit business?

Well, dad, I've thought about your question and here's your answer.

# The value of thinking *really hard* about complex problems for long periods of time

# The versatility of being able to learn new tools quickly

# The awkward-but-confident social skills that are becoming increasingly important

# Luckily my PhD is technical
