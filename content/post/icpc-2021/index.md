I started competing in programming competitions about a year ago, right around when the pandemic forced us all into quarantine. Since then I've competed in dozens of competitions, I've helped found and run the [BYU Competitive Programming Club](https://cpc.byu.edu/), and I've even started tutoring high school competitive programmers through [Juni Learning](https://junilearning.com/). It has all been incredibly rewarding.

Many people misunderstand what competitive programming actually is, if they've heard of it at all. It isn't hacking. It doesn't require 6 monitors or sunglasses or a cool colorful keyboard.
