[The History of the Atlanta Falcons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx_ORMhpmoU&t=12s&pp=ygUeaGlzdG9yeSBvZiB0aGUgYXRsYW50YSBmYWxjb25z) is the second hours-long sports team documentary produced by Jon Bois* and Alex Rubenstein, as part of their Dorktown "The History of" series. It's one of my favorite pieces of media that I've ever seen, and I rewatch it often.

*Side note: Jon Bois is also the author of my favorite book, the serialized multimedia narrative ["17776"](https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football) about a future space probe who gains consciousness and watches football with his friends.
