Hi! I’m Parker. I'm a second year PhD student in the [Dartmouth College Department of Computer Science](https://web.cs.dartmouth.edu/) and an Innovation Program Fellow in the [Dartmouth PhD Innovation Program](https://graduate.dartmouth.edu/academics/programs/phd-innovation-program-dartmouth). I do research at the intersection of ML, NLP and healthcare. I aim to develop and evaluate novel, hybrid neural-structured NLP systems to improve healthcare.

In addition to my research interests, I have a strong history in data science, sports (basketball/tennis/football) analytics, and teaching. I also love RPGs and cats.

Feel free to reach out (hmu on [twitter](https://twitter.com/pkseeg)), or read my latest research on [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bU_Xi10AAAAJ&hl=en). You can also download my {{< staticref "media/resume.pdf" "newtab" >}}current resumé here{{< /staticref >}}.
