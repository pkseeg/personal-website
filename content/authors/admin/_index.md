My name is Parker, I'm a first year PhD student in the Dartmouth College Department of Computer Science. 
My research interest spans the fields of machine learning and natural language processing, and in particular 
I aim to develop novel, explainable systems for structuring unstructured natural language data and to produce 
ML systems that leverage natural language to make intelligent decisions. 

I have a strong history in data science, sports analytics, and teaching.
