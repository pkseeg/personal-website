My name is Parker, I'm a second year PhD student in the Dartmouth College Department of Computer Science and an 
Innovation Program Fellow in the Dartmouth PhD Innovation Program. I do research at the intersection of 
machine learning, natural language processing and healthcare. I aim to develop and test novel, hybrid 
neural-structured systems to modernize healthcare.

I have a strong history in data science, sports analytics, and teaching.
